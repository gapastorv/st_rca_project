The second version now implies the login and signup implementations, 
also the mail checker now works with Gmail and Outlook. However, 
it's necessary to mention that this version doesn't join the mail 
checker with the main program yet, this will appear in the next version.

Consider this version to implement PyCharm, mainly because the code was 
applied with this IDE. Also, to run the main app page, apply:
'streamlit run Main_Page.py'
